# üê∞ Roo-Me: The All-You-Can-Eat Roomie Hunter
A testing app to integrate teammates' other project ideas, and data entries.
**Roo-Me** is a chaotic, causual, and fun take on roommate matching‚Äîdesigned by a dream team of tinkerers, designers, and low-key trolls. Think: Tinder meets Tarot, with a sprinkle of semi-working AI magic and a bunny filter.

 ### App Routines
 
 **1. User Registration Routine**
 - The user will sign up with an email, phone number, or social media account.
 - Upon registration, the user is prompted to complete their profile (personal information, budget, preferences, etc.).
 
 **2. Profile Matching Routine**
 - A user's preferences (budget, location, personality, etc.) will be analyzed and matched against others in the database.
 - The algorithm calculates a compatibility score, which is used to rank roommate suggestions.
 
 **3. Swipe-to-Match Routine**
 - Users can swipe through potential roommates, similar to Tinder‚Äôs swiping mechanic.
 - If two users swipe right (accept), a match is made, and they can begin chatting.
 
 **4. Messaging Routine**
 - Once matched, users can message each other to discuss the living situation, schedule meetings, and further assess compatibility.
 
 **5. Deep Fake Profile Generation Routine**
 - Users have the option to use a deep fake-generated image (based on AI technology) for their profile picture.
 - The deep fake technology allows for fun, creative avatars or images that represent the user‚Äôs personality or interests.

 ### Datasets
 
 To enable smooth matching and enhance user experience, we require the following datasets:
 
 - **User Profiles**: Data including location, budget, lifestyle preferences, and personal details.
     - Sample Dataset:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": 123,
       "location": "San Francisco",
       "budget": 1500,
       "preferences": ["clean", "night owl", "pets"],
       "personality": "outgoing"
     }
     ```
 
 - **Room Listings**: Data about available rooms and apartments (price, location, amenities).
     - Sample Dataset:
     ```json
     {
       "room_id": 456,
       "location": "San Francisco",
       "price": 1200,
       "amenities": ["wifi", "laundry", "parking"],
       "available_from": "2023-05-01"
     }
     ```
 
 - **User Matching Preferences**: Preferences for roommate matching (likes, dislikes, lifestyle).
     - Sample Dataset:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": 123,
       "ideal_roommate": {
         "budget": 1300,
         "lifestyle": "quiet",
         "cleanliness": "high",
         "pet_preference": "none"
       }
     }
     ```
 
 - **Swipe Data**: Tracks swipes (right/left) for users to help calculate compatibility scores.
     - Sample Dataset:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": 123,
       "swiped_right": [124, 125, 126],
       "swiped_left": [127, 128]
     }
     ```

 ## Roommate Matching Logic
 
 The roommate matching logic works through a scoring system based on user preferences and profile data.
 
 ### **1. Compatibility Scoring**
 - Compatibility is based on shared attributes such as cleanliness, lifestyle, budget, and pet preferences.
 - Each attribute is assigned a weight, and the system calculates an overall compatibility score between two users.
 
 ### **2. Deep Fake Profile Matching**
 - The deep fake profile image can be analyzed using facial recognition or aesthetic preferences to match users based on appearance or style preferences.

 ## Next Steps
 
 To turn this concept into a fully functioning app, the following tasks are next:
 
 1. **Prototype Development**: Start by building the front-end prototype, which includes the profile page, swipe functionality, and messaging system.
 2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement the roommate matching algorithm, including the scoring system and profile data parsing.
 3. **AI Integration**: Integrate deep fake technology to allow users to generate or upload creative profile images.
 4. **Testing**: Conduct user testing to refine the app's features and improve the matching process.
 5. **Deployment**: Deploy the app on mobile platforms (iOS/Android) and web.
